/**
 * Serves dist/ with the exact headers vercel.json will apply in production.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * `vite preview` serves the built site with no security headers at all, so the
 * production CSP is never exercised until the site is live. That gap shipped a
 * real outage: the Google Fonts <link> used an inline onload handler, which
 * `script-src 'self'` blocks, and every webfont on the site fell back to
 * Georgia and system-ui — visible only in production, perfect on localhost.
 *
 * This reads the policy out of vercel.json rather than restating it, so the
 * two cannot drift.
 *
 * WHY THE CACHING RULES LOOK THE WAY THEY DO (vercel.json cannot hold comments —
 * it is JSON, and Vercel's schema rejects unknown keys outright, failing the
 * deployment before the build even starts):
 *
 *   /assets, /fonts, /photos  -> immutable, one year.
 *       /assets is content-hashed by Vite, so changed content means a changed
 *       URL. /fonts filenames encode family+weight+subset, so a given name's
 *       bytes never change. /photos is slug-named and carries the same hazard
 *       the favicons hit, but these are the largest assets on the site; if a
 *       photograph is ever re-cropped, change its slug rather than its bytes.
 *
 *   favicons, og-image, tdp-*, site.webmanifest -> revalidate daily.
 *       These are UNVERSIONED names whose CONTENT changes in place. A blanket
 *       immutable rule for png/jpg/ico used to catch them, which told every
 *       browser never to revalidate for a year — so a favicon change never
 *       reached anyone who had already loaded the old one. immutable is only
 *       ever correct for content-hashed URLs.
 *
 *   They are written as separate literal sources rather than one alternation:
 *   Vercel parses `source` with path-to-regexp, where nested groups do not mean
 *   what they mean in a raw regex.
 *
 *   node scripts/preview-prod.js      -> http://localhost:4180
