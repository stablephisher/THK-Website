/**
 * Verifies that vercel.json's CSP whitelists the inline <script> in index.html.
 *
 * WHY THIS GUARD EXISTS
 * The production CSP is `script-src 'self'` with no 'unsafe-inline', which is
 * the point — but it means the one inline script in index.html (the boot
 * script that marks scripting as available before first paint) only runs if
 * its exact sha256 is listed in the policy.
 *
 * That coupling is invisible and silent: edit the script by one character and
 * the browser blocks it with no build error, no runtime error the site can
 * see, and no visual difference on localhost — because localhost never applies
 * vercel.json's headers. The site would ship subtly broken, which is exactly
 * how the Google Fonts breakage got to production in the first place.
 *
 * It checks dist/index.html, not the source: the hash must match the bytes the
 * browser actually receives, and the build normalises CRLF line endings, which
 * changes the digest. Runs after prerender, from `npm run build`.
