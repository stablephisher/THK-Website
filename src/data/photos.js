/**
 * Focal point per photograph, as a CSS object-position.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Every container on the site crops with object-fit:cover, and the default is
 * `50% 50%` — which is only correct when the subject happens to sit dead centre.
 * In press photography it almost never does. The bonam photograph is a 0.69
 * portrait whose subject's face sits at 58% height; centred in a near-square
 * box it pushed his face onto the bottom edge. The group photographs put their
 * faces in the upper third, so a centred crop clipped foreheads.
 *
 * These values were measured, not guessed: scripts/audit-images.py runs an
 * OpenCV cascade over every file and reports the area-weighted centre of the
 * faces it finds (scripts/image-audit.json). Where the detector found nothing,
 * or was dragged off by background faces, the value is corrected by eye and
 * the reason noted.

  // Corrected by eye. Ultra-wide at 2.22, no face detected against the busy

  // Corrected. The detector locked onto the two clearest faces on the right of

  // The focal points were tuned when the scrim was at the BOTTOM, where a

  // top, subjects need headroom and are better placed low, in the part of the
  // band the gradient leaves clear.
