/**
 * Shared page header.
 *
 * Two modes:
 *  - with `photo`: a full-bleed image with a TOP scrim and the title over it
 *  - without: a dark editorial band
 *
 * The copy sits at the top of the band, under a gradient that is dark at the
 * masthead and fully transparent by the middle. The previous arrangement put it
 * at the bottom behind a bottom-up scrim, which meant the darkest part of the
 * frame was the half containing the photograph's subject, and on a phone the
 * heading crowded straight up against the navigation bar. This way the type sits
 * in a band that is dark because it is meant to be, and the lower half of the
 * photograph is left completely alone.
 *
 * `focus` overrides the photograph's own measured focal point (photo.focus) for
 * this one placement. It is a CSS object-position value, not a class.
 *
 * The band is 52vh / 64vh rather than 46vh / 56vh. That is a legibility fix as
 * much as a design one: the eyebrow + h1 + lead stack is a fixed height, so a
 * taller band pushes it into a lower fraction of the frame, where the scrim is
 * strong. Measured with scripts/audit-images.py — at 56vh the text reached 66%
 * of the band and white type over the brighter photographs fell to 1.3:1; at
 * 64vh the same scrim clears 5.5:1 everywhere.
