/**
 * Links to the X accounts, in place of an embedded timeline.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE EMBED
 * It was an embedded timeline, and it rendered an empty frame. The cause is not
 * fixable from here: the account has essentially no posts, so X's syndication
 * endpoint returns a shell with no entries — measured at 1,017 bytes against
 * 178KB and 701KB for two large accounts checked as a control. The widget
 * itself worked, the CSP allowed it, and there was simply nothing to show.
 *
 * Shipping a box that is reliably empty is worse than not shipping one, so this
 * sends people to the accounts instead. It also drops a third-party script and
 * two framed origins from the page, which is why the CSP no longer carries the
 * twitter.com exceptions.
 *
 * It shows his account and the party's, per the office.
