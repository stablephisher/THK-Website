import { useState } from 'react'

/**
 * Responsive image.
 *
 * Serves WebP via srcset with a JPEG fallback, so a phone on a Telangana
 * mobile network pulls the 480px variant (~15-40KB) instead of the 1800px one.
 *
 * width/height are always emitted so the browser reserves the right box before
 * the bytes arrive — without them each image shifts the page as it loads (a
 * Cumulative Layout Shift penalty that Core Web Vitals measures directly).
 *
 * If a file is missing it falls back to a branded panel rather than a broken
 * image icon — the same guarantee the placeholder gave before real photography
 * existed.
 *
 * CROPPING. Every box here crops with object-fit:cover, so something has to say
 * WHICH part survives. That is `photo.focus`, a measured per-photograph focal
 * point (see the FOCUS map in src/data/photos.js). It is applied as an inline
 * style rather than a Tailwind object-[...] class deliberately: the value comes
 * from data, and arbitrary-value classes cannot be generated from data at build
 * time — Tailwind scans source text, so a class built from a variable is never
 * emitted and silently does nothing. `position` overrides it per usage.
